        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>A border frames the element and can be seen by added size and color.</li>

          <li>Select all of the elements in the HTML document with the * selector.</li>

          <li>Set class level properties by using a . before the class name.</li>

          <li>Select multiple HTML elements for a CSS property by separating them with a comma.</li>

          <li>display: block assigns each element to start on a new line.</li>

          <li>Use the box-shadow property to add a shadow to any element, like the sections in this page!</li>

          <li>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</li>

            The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>

          <li>git commit -m "commit message written as imperative commands in present tense."</li>

          <li>git pull origin main command ensures our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. This let's us pull down any changes from the base branch.</li>

        <ul>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>

          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>

          <li>In an 'if statement', the computer is looking to execture the logic of the 'truthy' condition.</li>

          <li>Values that evaluate to "falsy" are: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>

          <li>Use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>

          <li>Use Chrome DevTools to View console.log Output.</li>

          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>

          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>

          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>

          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>

          <li>A function will only execute if it is called.</li>

          <li>Math.random() returns a A floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).</li>
